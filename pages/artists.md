A first year student in Indiana University's Dual Degree Masters of Library Science and Art History Master's program, and the creator of this collection, Julia is interested in studying the fiber and textile work of her relatives, as well as much more celebrated artists such as Faith Ringgold. As a child on weekend trips to her Grandma Kathy's house, she learned to sew sitting at the machine on her grandma's knee, helping to guide the fabric though her legs were too short to press the pedal. Beyond her academic interests, her current hands-on engagement with fiber and texile work is primarily practical, such as adding a button or fixing a hem. She typically enjoys alternate forms of artistic expression, but the collection does include a lone example of her textile work. Although an infrequent practitioner, Julia is an avid fan of fiber and textile art, particularly vintage embroidery, as evidenced by both her wardrobe and apartment decor.
