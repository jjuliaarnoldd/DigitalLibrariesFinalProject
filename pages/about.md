# About the Collection
### In loving memory of Elaine Dye.

This collection highlights the fiber and textile art of four generations of women in the Dye/Fischer/Arnold family. In addition to bringing a variety of pieces together in one place, the collection is intended to celebrate the medium as fiber and textile work has not always been accorded the same levels of recognition or appreciation as that which has been termed "fine" or "high" art.

The collection's featured image showcases a small selection of unattributed and undated pieces, which precludes them from inclusion in the collection itself. The total body of textile and fiber art created across the generations is significantly larger, but unfortunately, many works are without any specific identifying information, so no metadata can be generated. The featured image, as well as the picture at the top of this page and the two below this paragraph, are intended to illustrate the much broader scope of work that exists beyond the collection. Table runners, napkins, doilies, and other textile pieces intended to serve a functional, everyday purpose comprise a significant portion of the unincluded work, and though they have not been featured in the collection itself, they still are still greatly appreciated and used daily.

Most of the works included in the collection have been created with special occasions in mind, which was especially helpful when it came to building out the metadata.

Although it was ultimately completed during the process of the project, only the "work in progress" version of the above cross-stitch is included in the collection, in hope of demonstrating its dynamic and continually evolving nature. These closing images are
