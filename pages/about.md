# About the Collection
### In loving memory of Elaine Dye.

This collection highlights the fiber and textile art of four generations of women in the Dye/Fischer/Arnold family. In addition to bringing a variety of pieces together in one place, the collection is intended to celebrate the medium as fiber and textile work have not always been accorded the same levels of appreciation as "fine" or "high" art.

The collection's featured image includes a selection of pieces that are unattributed and undated, which precludes them from inclusion in the collection itself.

{% include feature/image.html objectid="/objects/sarah:sophiacrossstitchwip3.jpg;/objects/completedcrossstitch.jpg" width="75" caption="A large floral cross-stitch with a bee, still in the embroidery frame as it is a work in progress.;Completed piece with cross-stitching by Sarah Arnold and back-stitching by Sophia Arnold." %}
Although it was ultimatley completed during the process of the project, only the "work in progress" version of the above cross-stitch is included in the collection, in hope of demonstrating its dynamic and continually evolving nature.
